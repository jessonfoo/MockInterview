/*

Given a 01 matrix M, find the longest line of consecutive one in the matrix. The line could be horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal.

Example:

Input:
[[0,1,1,0],
 [0,1,1,0],
 [0,0,0,1]]
Output: 3

Hint: The number of elements in the given matrix will not exceed 10,000.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

/*
Decode String

Difficulty:Medium

Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].

Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}

var decodeString = function(s) {
    
};
